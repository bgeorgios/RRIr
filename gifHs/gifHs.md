The script *gifHs.R* is meant for animating inundation depth, i.e., creating a .gif file from a collection of RRI **hs.out** files. The script requires RRI **time.dat** and **RRI_input.txt** files, both found at an RRI project folder. An RRI **dem.txt** file, typically found inside the topo folder of an RRI project, is also required.
