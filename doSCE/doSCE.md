*doSCE.R* implements the Shuffled Complex Evolution (SCE) algorithm for automatic calibration of RRI model parameters. The package ***hydromad*** must be previously installed before running the script. The script illustrates optimization of 10 parameters when the processes of infiltration + surface runoff (due to infiltration excess) are considered. It can be modified as per user's need to accommodate more/less parameters depending on the RRI model configuration.
