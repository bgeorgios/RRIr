# RRIr
RRIr is a collection of R scripts for pre/post-processing of the Rainfall-Runoff-Inundation (RRI) model input/output files.

RRI (**Sayama et al. 2012**) is a 2D model capable of simulating rainfall-runoff and flood inundation simultaneously. All copyrights of the original model belong to the International Centre for Water-related Hazard and Risk Management of the Public Works Research Institute (ICHARM-PWRI), Tsukuba, Japan.

The R scripts published here aim to aid preparation of model input data and visualization of model results with the use of a modern programming language.
