The script *gifHS.R* is meant for animating i.e., creating a .gif file from a collection of RRI hs.out files. The script requires an RRI **time.dat** and **RRI_input.txt** file, both found at an RRI project folder. An RRI **dem.txt** file, typically found inside the topo folder of an RRI project, is also required.
